**POTATOES** is a small computer operating system for x86 instruction set architectures written in ANSI C and assembly language. It was developed by Daniel Bader, Vincenz Dölle, Johannes Schamburger, and Dmitriy Traytel during the 2008 summer term at Technische Universität München. The project was later used over three terms in the "Introduction to Operating Systems" lecture at TU München.
